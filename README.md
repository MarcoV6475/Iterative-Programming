Iterative-Programming-Description
#In CSS-225 we read a chapter learning about the turtle methods. It explained many features we can do in python; for example we can draw by importing the turtle commands. Next, we had 5 problems to do in this weeks
#assignment, each one involved the loops, turtle methods, and creating flowchart to match our work. Overall, this week taught me a lot and also helped me gained a better understanding of how python is used in the
#real world.
